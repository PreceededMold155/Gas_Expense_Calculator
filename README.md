# Gas Expense Calculator
I created this project as a hobby. I determined that the code was accurate
but could use some work. I leave this project up to the community to work on throughout
my days. I cannot wait to see what you do with this. But any contribution to make this even better would be nice.
I started work on this java program initially to help my family determine how much we were gonna be spending so that we
could steer ourselves into the right financial decisions. While it still turned out to be a shitshow Im still glad we got to Vermont!
Anyway. Feel free to port this to another language(Might not work with C or C# but feel free to prove us wrong)
